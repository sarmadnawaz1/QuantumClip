The monarch butterfly migration is one of nature's most incredible phenomena.

These delicate insects travel up to 3,000 miles from Canada and the United States to central Mexico every year.

What makes this journey remarkable is that no single butterfly completes the entire round trip. It takes multiple generations to make the full migration cycle.

The butterflies that return to the starting point are the great-great-grandchildren of those that began the journey.

Scientists still don't fully understand how they navigate with such precision to the same locations year after year.
