This is a sample script for the first video.

It demonstrates how the custom scripts from folder feature works.

Each paragraph will be treated as a separate scene in the video.

The filename (without extension) will be used as the title for the video.

You can create multiple script files in a folder and generate videos for all of them in batch.
